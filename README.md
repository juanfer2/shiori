# Shiori Example

This example deploys a self-hosted version of [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori) - A simple bookmarks manager intended to be a [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) clone. Shiori is written in Go and the self-hosted example on Railway uses PostgreSQL to store and manage the bookmarks.
